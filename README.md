# pi-montecarlo
better understand monte carlo methods by approximating pi by randomly generating numbers

## How to run
- Download R
- Navigate to an environment where you can run R code (I use [RStudio](https://www.rstudio.com/)) and run every line in `pi.r`
- Play around with `num_points` to get different approximations
